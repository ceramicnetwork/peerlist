## üåê Ceramic Peerlist (Superceded)
This repository was used as a temporary solution for peer discovery in Ceramic. It served as a list of Ceramic nodes used as a bootstrap mechanism for peer discovery on the [Ceramic Network](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic). When you started up a new Ceramic node this repository was queried to discover available peers and connect to them.
