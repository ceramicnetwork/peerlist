# üåê Ceramic Peerlist

This repository contains a list of Ceramic nodes that can be used as a bootstrap mechanism for peer discovery on the [Ceramic Network](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic). When you start up a new Ceramic node it will automatically query this repository to discover available peers and connect to them. 

> **‚ö†Ô∏è  If you're running a Cermic node, you need to add your node to this list. If you don't, then other nodes on the network will be unable to read Ceramic documents or commits created on your node**

## Adding your node
Submit a pull request to this repository adding the *multiaddress* of your node to the correct peerlist file. Before you do so, make sure that the correct port is open so that other peers can make connections to your node. Peerlist files are organized by name of the Ceramic network. Currently, there are three peerlists:

- **[`mainnet.json`](mainnet.json)**: A list of nodes that run the `mainnet` Ceramic network
- **[`testnet-clay.json`](testnet-clay.json)**: A list of nodes that run the `testnet-clay` Ceramic network
- **[`dev-unstable.json`](dev-unstable.json)**: A list of nodes that run the `dev-unstable` Ceramic network

### Find your *multiaddress*
When you start the Ceramic daemon you will get an output that looks something like this:

```sh
$ ceramic daemon
Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4002/p2p/QmNZfs1Vevknvmykz3fWKTjhmEpckabhd2JyEGJuymZFsC
Swarm listening on /ip4/192.168.188.22/tcp/4002/p2p/QmNZfs1Vevknvmykz3fWKTjhmEpckabhd2JyEGJuymZFsC
Swarm listening on /ip4/10.70.198.64/tcp/4002/p2p/QmNZfs1Vevknvmykz3fWKTjhmEpckabhd2JyEGJuymZFsC
Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4003/ws/p2p/QmNZfs1Vevknvmykz3fWKTjhmEpckabhd2JyEGJuymZFsC
```

It is recommended that you use a websocket multiaddress with SSL. Make sure that the appropriate port is open (`4003` in the example above), then replace `127.0.0.1` with your external IP address. You may also choose to configure your multiaddress with a DNS name (see [multiaddress docs](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr)).

If you run an IPFS node external to the Ceramic daemon, you will see a similar log output on startup and you can simply get the multiaddress from there.

## Why peerlist?

Peerlist is a *temporary* solution for peer discovery in Ceramic that will be used during the Clay testnet. Peerlist is needed because the current JavaScript implementation of the DHT in `libp2p` (a p2p networking library used in Ceramic) is not yet sufficient to deliver optimal performance for a live decentralized network. However when Ceramic launches Fire mainnet near the end of Q1 2021, we will replace `peerlist` with the purely decentralized peer-to-peer discovery mechanism provided by libp2p. üöÄ
